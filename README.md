# Chess Web Application

This project is a web-based chess application designed to help chess players improve their work and analysis more efficiently.  
Although many chess websites and applications already exist, we identified a lack of **accessible, free, and practical PGN replay tools**, especially ones that work smoothly on both desktop and mobile devices.

Our application allows users to **upload and replay PGN files** in a clear and intuitive way, making game analysis faster and more practical.  
In addition, we implemented an **Elo rating calculator**, a feature that is often difficult to find on popular chess platforms. This calculator helps players better understand how their rating changes over time.

The application focuses on **simplicity, usability, and clean design**, ensuring an intuitive user experience for all levels of chess players.  
The goal was to combine two essential chess tools — a PGN viewer and an Elo calculator — into a single, easily accessible webpage, with the possibility of adding more features in the future.
